TODO
 - joystick selection (in case I have two joysticks..)
 - sound emulation http://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/Gameboy_sound_hardware
 - color from super gameboy palettes
 - Netplay is not compatible with Tetris Attack, Tennis, Tetris Plus, Battle City, Flipull and Spy vs Spy (but works more or less okay with Tetris, Tetris 2 Dr. Mario and Tetris Blast so far) - doing it right should enforce communication so both emulators block when needing to receive data from the other one (and send anything even when no data is actually transferred). Also, I am not sure if I fire serial INTerrupts after sending/receiving data... need to check.
 - Figure out whether I should increment LY when LCD is off or not
 - When Yoshi's cookie asks for continuing after a gameover, the selection choice is not visible (only empty boxes are displayed)
 - Add Hi-Scores saving to Tetris 2
 - Add Hi-Scores saving to Crystal Quest
 - Add Hi-Scores saving to Yoshi's Cookie
 - Add Hi-Scores saving to Tail Gator
 - Add Hi-Scores saving to Pinball - revenge of the gator
 - WordZap is hanging after intro screen with an invalid mem bank
 - Blaster Master crashes with an invalid ROM bank message
 - When playing Aladdin, the status bar is not displayed (garbage is shown instead)
 - In Gameboy Wars Turbo some games sprites are totally screwed
 - The "Pac-Attack" game from the "Pac-Man special color edition (GBC)" ROM is crashing with invalid ROM bank message
 - Check if no way to merge some areas of virtual memory.. it would make MMU processing easier (and faster)
 - Turok: Battle of the Bionosaurs is crashing with a stop-like instruction when entering to the first cave
 - Amazing penguin is hanging with an invalid ROM bank message
 - Great Greed is hanging with an invalid ROM bank message
 - A-Force is not starting (stuck with a white screen)
 - The intro screen of Magic Maze tries to use a special effect which is severly fucked up
 - 2nd Space is immediately hanging with unknown opcode "FD"
 - Kirby's Pinball Land is not starting (white screen)
 - Daffy Duck: The Marvin mission have a bad intro display
 - Add support for reseting the LY counter (what should I do when it happens?)
 - Race Days (Dirty Racing) at intro is wrongly scrolling background graphic at intro
 - Pinball Fantasies, Pinball Deluxe, Pinball Mania and Pinball Dreams have the first pixel row flashing when playing
 - Kirby Dreamland 2 is hanging after few seconds of intro with an unknown opcode "FD"
 - Super Mario Land 2 crash with an "UNKNOWN OPCODE" message
 - In intro screen of the "Swamp Thing", the window part is flashing
 - In intro screen of the "Attack of Killer Tomatoes", the window part is flashing
 - DrawBackground seems buggy - check on Worm Visitor
 - Donkey Kong is displaying some trash before starting
 - Test MemoryWrite16() (opcode 08h)
 - Check the part of MBC1.c file taged as "#784632" (why am I doing such thing?)
 - Add support for RUMBLES (at least interpret in a right way ROM addressing when rumbles are available)
 - Add support for RAM bank disabling (not sure if RAM banks are disableable one by one or as a whole...)
 - Check support for SCX and SCY (ScrollX/ScrollY) register
 - Ant Soldiers intro is scrolling text OR picture, both are never displayed (probably related bad scanline timing)
 - Check if I need to request interrupts for LCD modes 0,1,2,3 depending of STAT (FF41) - see page 53 of Gameboy CPU manual
 - Batman: return of the Joker: When playing, the window part (water) is flashing
 - Detect GBC ROMs which are known to not run in GB mode, and display an error screen
